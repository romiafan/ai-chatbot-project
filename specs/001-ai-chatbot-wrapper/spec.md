# Feature Specification: AI Chatbot Wrapper with Multi-Provider Support

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-chatbot-wrapper`  
**Created**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build me an app using this template , use minimal dependancy and best practice. Make me a AI-Chatbot wrapper for using gemini and chat gpt. User can chat, upload file for contex and toggle feature like RAG"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: How should API keys for OpenAI and Gemini be managed? → A: Hybrid (admin provides default keys, users can optionally override with their own)
- Q: What retrieval method should be used for RAG functionality? → A: Hybrid (combine keyword and semantic search results)
- Q: Which specific AI models should be supported for each provider? → A: User-configurable model selection

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Basic Chat Conversation (Priority: P1)

Users can engage in text-based conversations with AI assistants (ChatGPT or Gemini) through a web interface. The system maintains conversation history and provides real-time streaming responses.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that delivers immediate value. Without this, the chatbot has no purpose. This is the foundational capability upon which all other features depend.

**Independent Test**: User can open the app, select an AI provider, type a message, and receive a streaming response. The conversation persists in the interface and database, and the user can continue the conversation thread.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is authenticated and on the chat interface, **When** they type a message and press send, **Then** the message appears in the chat history and an AI response begins streaming within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a user has an existing conversation, **When** they send a new message, **Then** the conversation context is maintained and the AI responds appropriately to previous messages
3. **Given** a user is viewing the chat interface, **When** an AI response is streaming, **Then** they see the text appear progressively character by character or word by word
4. **Given** a user sends a message, **When** the AI provider is unavailable or returns an error, **Then** they see a user-friendly error message and can retry

### User Story 2 - AI Provider Selection (Priority: P1)

Users can switch between different AI providers (ChatGPT and Gemini) and select specific models within each provider to compare responses, leverage different strengths, or work around rate limits and availability issues.

**Why this priority**: Differentiates this from single-provider wrappers and provides immediate value through flexibility. Essential for users who want to compare AI models or have access to multiple API keys.

**Independent Test**: User can select ChatGPT from a provider dropdown, choose GPT-4o from a model dropdown, send a message and receive a response, then switch to Gemini and select Gemini 1.5 Pro, send another message, and receive a response from the new provider and model. The interface clearly indicates which provider and model are active.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the chat interface, **When** they click the provider selector, **Then** they see available providers (ChatGPT and Gemini) with clear labels
2. **Given** a user selects a different provider, **When** they send a message, **Then** the response comes from the newly selected provider and the interface indicates the active provider
3. **Given** a user switches providers mid-conversation, **When** they continue chatting, **Then** the new provider receives the full conversation history for context
4. **Given** a user has not configured API keys for a provider, **When** they attempt to select it, **Then** they see a notification about missing configuration with guidance on setup
5. **Given** a user selects a provider, **When** they click the model selector, **Then** they see available models for that provider (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini for OpenAI)
6. **Given** a user selects a specific model, **When** they send a message, **Then** the response is generated using the selected model and the interface displays which model was used

### User Story 3 - File Upload for Context (Priority: P2)

Users can upload files (text, PDF, images) to provide additional context to the AI assistant. The system extracts content from files and includes it in the conversation context.

**Why this priority**: Significantly enhances chatbot utility for real-world tasks like document analysis, code review, and image understanding. This is a key differentiator but requires the base chat functionality (P1) to exist first.

**Independent Test**: User can click an upload button, select a PDF file from their computer, see the file appear in the chat interface with a preview or filename, send a message asking about the file content, and receive a relevant response that demonstrates the AI has access to the file content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is in a conversation, **When** they click the upload button and select a supported file, **Then** the file is uploaded, processed, and appears in the chat with a visual indicator
2. **Given** a user has uploaded a text file, **When** they ask a question about the file content, **Then** the AI response demonstrates understanding of the file content
3. **Given** a user uploads an image, **When** they ask about the image, **Then** the AI (if vision-capable) describes or analyzes the image content
4. **Given** a user uploads a large file exceeding the size limit, **When** the upload completes, **Then** they see an error message indicating the file is too large with the specific size limit
5. **Given** a user uploads an unsupported file format, **When** the system processes it, **Then** they see an error message listing supported formats

---

### User Story 4 - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Toggle (Priority: P2)

Users can enable or disable RAG functionality to control whether the AI searches through uploaded documents and conversation history for relevant context before responding.

**Why this priority**: Advanced feature that improves response accuracy for knowledge-intensive tasks. Depends on file upload (P2) and conversation history (P1), so it naturally comes after those foundational pieces.

**Independent Test**: User can toggle RAG on, upload multiple documents, ask a question that requires information from those documents, and receive a response citing relevant passages. When toggled off, the same question receives a response without document retrieval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has uploaded multiple documents and RAG is enabled, **When** they ask a question, **Then** the system searches the documents for relevant content and the AI response references specific information from the documents
2. **Given** a user has RAG enabled, **When** they ask a question, **Then** they see which documents or conversation snippets were used as context (source citations)
3. **Given** a user toggles RAG off, **When** they send a message, **Then** the AI responds using only the immediate conversation context without searching uploaded documents
4. **Given** a user has no documents uploaded and enables RAG, **When** they send a message, **Then** the system behaves normally (RAG has no effect) with no errors
5. **Given** a user has RAG enabled with many documents, **When** they send a message, **Then** the response includes only the most relevant document excerpts (not all documents)

---

### User Story 5 - Conversation Management (Priority: P3)

Users can create multiple conversations, view conversation history, rename conversations, delete conversations, and search through past conversations.

**Why this priority**: Quality-of-life feature that becomes valuable as users accumulate conversations. Not essential for initial testing but important for ongoing usability.

**Independent Test**: User can click "New Conversation", start a fresh chat, navigate back to view a list of all conversations with titles and timestamps, click on an old conversation to resume it, rename a conversation by clicking an edit icon, and delete a conversation permanently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has multiple conversations, **When** they view the sidebar, **Then** they see a list of all conversations with titles (or first message preview) and timestamps
2. **Given** a user is in a conversation, **When** they click "New Conversation", **Then** a fresh chat starts and the previous conversation is saved
3. **Given** a user views their conversation list, **When** they click on a conversation, **Then** the full conversation history loads with all messages and uploaded files
4. **Given** a user wants to organize conversations, **When** they click rename/edit on a conversation, **Then** they can provide a custom title that appears in the sidebar
5. **Given** a user deletes a conversation, **When** they confirm the action, **Then** the conversation is permanently removed and no longer appears in the list

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user uploads a 100MB file? (System should enforce size limits - assume 10MB max per file)
- How does the system handle API rate limits from OpenAI or Google? (Display user-friendly error with retry suggestions)
- What happens if a user's API key is invalid or expired? (Show configuration error with link to settings)
- How does RAG perform with 50+ uploaded documents? (System should limit to reasonable document count - assume 20 documents max per conversation)
- What happens when a user tries to send a message while the previous response is still streaming? (Queue the message or disable send button until streaming completes)
- How does the system handle very long conversations (1000+ messages)? (Implement context window management - keep most recent N messages and relevant retrieved context)
- What happens when a user uploads a file in an unsupported language? (Process as-is if possible, or notify user of unsupported language)
- How does the system handle images when using a text-only model? (Notify user that selected provider doesn't support images, suggest switching to vision-capable model)
