# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Chatbot Wrapper with Multi-Provider Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: October 19, 2025

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - The specification maintains proper abstraction levels throughout:

- No mention of specific frameworks (React, Next.js, etc.)
- No code-level details
- Focuses on user capabilities and outcomes
- Uses business language (conversations, messages, file uploads)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous:

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all reasonable defaults documented (10MB file limit, 20 documents max, supported file formats)
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-007 specifies exact file formats)
- Success criteria use specific metrics (5 seconds, 90% accuracy, 95% success rate)
- All success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "streaming responses with visible progressive text" instead of "WebSocket streaming")
- 5 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 8 edge cases identified with assumed resolutions
- Scope clearly bounded: 2 AI providers, 5 user stories with priorities, specific file types
- Dependencies explicit: Clerk authentication (existing), Convex database (existing)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - The specification is ready for planning:

- All 25 functional requirements map to user stories and success criteria
- User stories cover the complete user journey from basic chat (P1) to advanced features (P2-P3)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 directly validate the requirements
- Implementation-agnostic throughout (e.g., "retrieval mechanism" for RAG instead of "vector database")

## Assumptions Documented

The specification makes these reasonable assumptions (documented in edge cases and requirements):

1. **File size limit**: 10MB maximum per file upload (industry standard for web apps)
2. **Document limit**: 20 documents maximum per conversation (prevents performance issues)
3. **Supported formats**: .txt, .md, .pdf, .png, .jpg, .jpeg (common document types)
4. **Context window**: System manages token limits automatically (standard AI app practice)
5. **Authentication**: Uses existing Clerk integration from template
6. **Database**: Uses existing Convex integration from template
7. **Response time**: 5-second target for AI responses (reasonable for streaming APIs)
8. **Error handling**: User-friendly messages for all error scenarios (UX best practice)

## Notes

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.

No blocking issues identified. The specification successfully:

- Prioritizes features (P1 > P2 > P3) for incremental delivery
- Defines testable acceptance criteria for each user story
- Establishes measurable success criteria without implementation details
- Identifies key entities and their relationships
- Documents edge cases with reasonable resolution strategies
- Maintains focus on user value throughout
