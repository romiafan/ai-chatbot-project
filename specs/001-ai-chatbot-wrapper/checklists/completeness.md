## Notes

- **Usage**: Check items off as you verify each requirement is complete: `[x]`
- **Traceability**: Each item includes references to spec sections, plan sections, or task IDs
- **Focus**: This checklist prioritizes completeness and gap prevention based on recent analysis findings
- **Next Steps**: After completing this checklist, proceed with implementation starting at Phase 1 (Setup)
- **Gap Markers**: [Gap Check] indicates requirements that may be missing entirely and need verification
- **Updates**: If you discover missing requirements during this review, update spec.md/plan.md/tasks.md before starting implementation
